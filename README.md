# Dooley's latex HW template
My current latex template for your consideration.

I use this template to start all of my homework assignments at NMT. This document has been continuously updated since Fall 2016. 

The documnet actually begins at around line 250, after a long preamble. You can enter your name and class/HW info on line 12.

lines 20-80 are shorthand functions that I use often such as \quotes{} to create good quotations, \SIN{} to save me time with writing \left(\right), and \GOTO which creates a well spaced right arrow in the math environment. There are many more that you can play around with.

lines ~140 to 240 define commands lstlisting commands that are good for entering code in the document. I have set specific styles for PYTHON, MATLAB, C, assembly, Rscript, and OTHER.
